The temporal, geographic, and financial scale of a given conservation project will largely determine which of the thousand cuts is addressed, with a number of options presented below.</p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=regional-responsibility class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Regional Responsibility</h2></header><section class=post-content><p>SPACE HOLDER FOR NOW</p><p style=font-size:10pt;text-align:right;margin-right:3%><a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_LandingPage/>Home</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Current_Knowledge/>Current Knowledge</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Threats/>Threats</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Next_Steps/>Next Steps</a></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=imporant-habitats class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Imporant Habitats</h2></header><section class=post-content><p>Since many are closely tied to individual flower species or genera, planting and encouraging flowers that support threatened bees is both scalable and actionable. Other habitats such as mature hardwoods and sandpits are known to support unique bee communities, and deserve consideration when planning bee-focused conservation actions. The following list of plant communities or other habitats support a high proportion of unique and/or imperiled bee species.</p><div class=doubleColumn><div><b>Sandpits</b>
<img alt=Sandpit_species src="images/Sphecodes johnsonii.jpg" style="margin:0px height:500px;width:500px;position:relative"></div><div><p style=font-size:10pt;line-heigth:10pt><b>Loosestrife and Dogbane</b></p><img alt=Loosestrife src=https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/85350669 style="margin:0px height:500px;width:500px"></div></div><p><b>Sandpits</b></p><p>The presence of exposed, deep, and relatively pure sand is the strongest indicator of bee diversity at the site level. The ease of digging and lack of moisture retention are probably the biggest factors in the frequent dependence on sand, as both are advantageous for many ground-nesting species. Additionally, many unique flowering plants are also found at sandy sites, which likely has a non-negligible effect on the associated bee community.
Unfortunately sandy soils are also prime development sites given the ease of landscaping and septic capacity. While some forms of development appear to be suitable for a number of rare bee species, the planting of lawn grasses and other ground cover may reduce the exposed soil available for nesting bees. Actively managed sandpits are among the most reliable places to find frequently disturbed sand and many of VT’s sand obligates (bees, tiger beetles, other insects, and Sand Martins), but these are often considered unsightly and targeted for “restoration”. Additionally, sand pits have been proposed by Regional Planning Commissions as priority sights for large scale solar development. Given the limited number of sand deposits in the state and the high proportion of rare bees dependent on this habitat, this should be a major conservation priority in the immediate future. Bee (or other sand associate) conservation may look different than more traditional conservation, as some human mediated disturbance is probably important to maximize nest site availability and floral resources in the vicinity.</p><p><b>Loosestrife and Dogbane</b>
The genus Macropis is another group that should be a target of conservation efforts. All three species in eastern North America are specialists on Lysimachia, though not all Lysimachia are suitable host plants. This genus is less common in contemporary collections than it is in historical collections (cite) and is the only host for Epeoloides pilosulus an RSGCN high concern species likely has occurred, and may still occur in Vermont. Patellate Yellow Loosestrife Bee (Macropis patellata) is an RSGCN high concern species that has been found twice recently at one location in Vermont but very few other sites globally. The site in Vermont is protected, but intentional management is likely needed to maintain a healthy population of Lysimachia at this site.</p><p><b>Wetlands</b>
Prior to human clearing of forests, wetlands probably provided the largest and most stable open habitats in the northeast. Unlike the understory of mature forests, wetlands have substantial sun exposure throughout the growing season, which has significant implications for bee and flower diversity and abundance. Several wetland obligates (and many facultative wetland plants) are hosts to specialist bees. Pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata) and Water lilies (Family Nymphaeaceae) are both reported as host plants for uncommon to rare bee species - the Pickerelweed Longhorn (Melissodes apicatus) and Water-lily Sweat Bee (Lasioglossum nelumbonis) respectively. A number of other uncommon to rare bees appear to be associated with wetlands, but not particular flowers. The Nelumbo Masked Bee (Hylaeus nelumbonis), Ocean Grove Metallic-Sweat bee (Lasioglossum oceanicum), and several others appear to be confined to wetland habitats. Wooded wetlands often contain unique plants (Ilex verticillata, Kalmia angustifolia) and their associated bees (Colletes banksi, Andrena kalmiae) as well as abundant standing dead wood, which is an important nesting resource for many bees.</p><p><b>Power Right-Of-Ways</b>
Often maligned as ugly and fragmenting, power line corridors and other right-of-ways can support exceptionally high bee diversity, including a number of rare specialists. The specifics of the vegetation management regime have significant consequences for the plant (and therefore) the bee community that occupies these sites. Invasive plants such as Honeysuckle, buckthorn, reed canary grass, and many others can quickly overrun these sites and choke out native plants and specialist bees, though many introduced plants are frequent food for bumble bees and other native generalists. The following shrubs and forbs are often found along ROWs and support rare and/or specialist bees: Willows, Dogwoods (swinda group), Sheep Laurel, Maleberry, Fireweed, Brambles, Blueberries, and Yellow Loosestrifes.</p><p><b>Rich hardwoods</b>
Prior to European colonization, the northeastern US was dominated by old growth hardwood forests. While often overlooked in bee conservation efforts, mature forests provide a number of crucial resources for both specialists and generalists. Rotten logs, standing deadwood, and rodent burrows on the forest floor are all used as nesting sites by a number of different bee genera. Additionally, at least seven species in VT specialize in spring ephemerals or other woodland flowers. Finally, flowering trees including maples, hickory, chestnut, and basswood are attractive to many different bees, though often overlooked by, or inaccessible to, beewatchers. Andrena rehni, reportedly a chestnut specialist, was probably once widespread in northeastern forest.
Despite an increase in forest cover in Vermont over the past century, this habitat is not without conservation concern. Historical pasture is unlikely to return to a forest with the same floral diversity as land that’s been in continuous forest plus on-going threats, primarily in the form of invasive species (earthworms, Emerald Ash Borer, garlic mustard, etc) are altering forest communities, likely to the detriment of forest-adapted bees.</p><p><b>Fens</b>
Andrena parnassiae is a specialist on Fen Grass (Parnassia), a fall blooming flower found in calcareous fens and river bank communities. Anecdotal reports suggest this plant is severely threatened in much of its range by development, nutrification, and invasive species. In Vermont, this flower and bee are regularly found at numerous sites but may be threatened by the same pressures in the future.</p><p><b>Community Gardens and Diversified Farms</b>
Though far from a natural community, small-scale fruit and vegetable farms are an important habitat for a number of rare and uncommon bees. Many farms and community gardens share a similar suite of flower plants and associated bees, including examples of both that are rare to absent in more natural habitats. Tomatillos and Ground Cherries (genus Physalis), Squash, Blueberries, and Sunflowers are all cultivated commercially in Vermont and support specialist bees. Several uncommon specialists appear to have healthy populations on local farms, though caution is warranted. Commercial techniques such as pesticides, frequent tillage, and pollenless sunflowers have the potential to attract but then negatively impact specialist bees and other native insects.</p><p style=font-size:10pt;text-align:right;margin-right:3%><a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_LandingPage/>Home</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Current_Knowledge/>Current Knowledge</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Threats/>Threats</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Next_Steps/>Next Steps</a></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=important-bee-areas class=post><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Important Bee Areas</h2></header><section class=post-content><div class=lead><h4>12 Important Bee Areas (IBeeA’s) for potential protection and bee-focused management</h4></div><p>Building on the concept of Important Bird Areas (Birdlife International), we propose the following areas as Important Bee Areas. These parts of the state have been identified as containing regionally rare species and/or examples of high-quality habitat for a large number of Vermont’s bees. Occurrence data used to generate this list comes primarily from sampling conducted between 2019 and 2021 and thus is heavily biased towards sites with public access that were visited repeatedly during this project. Regardless, we believe this list is a meaningful step in identifying the areas of the state most crucial to conserving the full diversity of bees found in Vermont. All of these areas contain a mix of conserved, public land and privatly owned land, and each with a unique set of threats and conservation priorities. More detailed management suggestions are in the works for many of the habitats and species covered by these IBeeAs, but its not too early for land managers to be considering rare bees in future management decisions.</p><div class=doubleColumn style=width:90%><div style=column-wide:100%><b><u>Important bee areas</u></b>, or IBeeAs for short were delineated using the following criteria:<ol><li>Support multiple rare or local bee species, with an emphasis on specialists and regionally rare species</li><li>Habitats that are geographically limited in the state, threatened by human impacts, and/or of regional significance</li><li>Extensive areas of relatively pristine and unique habitat</li></ol><p><b><u>Priority survey Regions</u></b> are areas with unique habitats or undersampled regions that we&rsquo;ve identified.

Bee communities are the assemblages of bee species that occur together in a given location. The species found within unique communities, however, can range from common to rare. Yet, the areas identified as unique bee communities are disproportionally important for bee diversity in Vermont. Many of these areas warrant further investigation and conservation action should be considered in these areas to maintain bee diversity.</div></div><p style=font-size:10pt;text-align:right;margin-right:3%><a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_LandingPage/>Home</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Current_Knowledge/>Current Knowledge</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Threats/>Threats</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Next_Steps/>Next Steps</a></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div><div class=post-holder><article id=backyard-conservation class='post last'><header class=post-header><h2 class=post-title>Backyard Conservation</h2></header><section class=post-content><div class=lead><h4>Since the vast majority of the state is privately owned, the future of Vermont’s bees is largely dependent on individuals and the management decisions made on everything from the ¼ acre lot to the 400 acre farm.</h4></div><p>Thanks to campaigns like No Mow May and Bee City USA, there is a growing interest in backyard bee conservation and a recognition that bee habitat is often compatible with human habitat. Pollinator gardens are one of most widely recognized ways to “save the bees”, though hedgerows and wild strips are often easier and more effective ways. Many resources for building backyard bee habitat exist, some of which are compiled here: <a href=https://val.vtecostudies.org/projects/vtbees/pollinator-habitat/>https://val.vtecostudies.org/projects/vtbees/pollinator-habitat/</a></p><p>While there is a lot that a landowner can do to actively encourage native bees, there is also a lot that inadvertently hurts native bees. Clearing of native shrubs, frequent mowing, and pesticide treatments are all likely to be harmful, as are a number of less obviously detrimental activities. Many nurseries sell plants that have been pre-treated with neonicotinoids, which are potentially toxic for visiting bees and other insect herbivores - ask about any treatments before you buy. Perhaps even more threatening, many companies are now selling live mason and leafcutter bees with bee hotels that can be installed in a garden to “increase the local bee population". Live bees (other than honey bees) should never be purchased for release, with the possible exception of bumble bee colonies for fruit or vegetable farms where there has been a demonstrated need. The interstate sale of mason and leafcutter bees appears to be entirely unregulated, despite a significant chance of spreading non-native bees, pathogens, and/or parasites, all of which have been shown to have negative consequences for native bee populations.</p><p style=font-size:10pt;text-align:right;margin-right:3%><a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_LandingPage/>Home</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Current_Knowledge/>Current Knowledge</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Threats/>Threats</a> | <a href=https://vtecostudies.github.io/SoBees_Next_Steps/>Next Steps</a></p></section></article><div class=post-after></div></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=inner><section class=copyright>© <a href=https://vtecostudies.org/>Vermont Center for Ecostudies</a></section><section></section><section><p style=text-align:center><b>Partners:</b><br></p><a href=https://vtfishandwildlife.com/ target=blank_><img src=images/VFW-Logo-RGB_transparent-background_0.png style=height:50px;width:50px;margin:0;padding-right:10px></a>
