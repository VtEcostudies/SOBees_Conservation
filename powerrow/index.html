Often maligned as ugly and fragmenting, power line corridors and other right-of-ways can support exceptionally high bee diversity, including a number of rare specialists. The specifics of the vegetation management regime have significant consequences for the plant (and therefore) the bee community that occupies these sites. Invasive plants such as Honeysuckle, buckthorn, reed canary grass, and many others can quickly overrun these sites and choke out native plants and specialist bees, though many introduced plants are frequent food for bumble bees and other native generalists. The following shrubs and forbs are often found along ROWs and support rare and/or specialist bees: Willows, Dogwoods (swinda group), Sheep Laurel, Maleberry, Fireweed, Brambles, Blueberries, and Yellow Loosestrifes.</p></section></article></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=inner><section class=copyright>Â© <a href=https://vtecostudies.org/>Vermont Center for Ecostudies</a></section><section></section><section><p style=text-align:center><b>Partners:</b><br></p><a href=https://vtfishandwildlife.com/ target=blank_><img src=images/VFW-Logo-RGB_transparent-background_0.png style=height:50px;width:50px;margin:0;padding-right:10px></a>
