<b>Loosestrife and Dogbane</b>
The genus Macropis is another group that should be a target of conservation efforts. All three species in eastern North America are specialists on Lysimachia, though not all Lysimachia are suitable host plants. This genus is less common in contemporary collections than it is in historical collections (cite) and is the only host for Epeoloides pilosulus an RSGCN high concern species likely has occurred, and may still occur in Vermont. Patellate Yellow Loosestrife Bee (Macropis patellata) is an RSGCN high concern species that has been found twice recently at one location in Vermont but very few other sites globally. The site in Vermont is protected, but intentional management is likely needed to maintain a healthy population of Lysimachia at this site.
