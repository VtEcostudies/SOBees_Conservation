Though far from a natural community, small-scale fruit and vegetable farms are an important habitat for a number of rare and uncommon bees.
Many farms and community gardens share a similar suite of flower plants and associated bees, including examples of both that are rare to absent
in more natural habitats. Tomatillos and Ground Cherries (genus <i>Physalis</i>), Squash, Blueberries, and Sunflowers are all cultivated commercially 
in Vermont and support specialist bees. Several uncommon specialists appear to have healthy populations on local farms, though caution is warranted.
 Commercial techniques such as pesticides, frequent tillage, and pollenless sunflowers have the potential to attract but then negatively impact 
 specialist bees and other native insects.
