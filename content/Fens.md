<b>Fens</b>

Andrena parnassiae is a specialist on Fen Grass (Parnassia), a fall blooming flower found in calcareous fens and river bank communities. Anecdotal reports suggest this plant is severely threatened in much of its range by development, nutrification, and invasive species. In Vermont, this flower and bee are regularly found at numerous sites but may be threatened by the same pressures in the future.
