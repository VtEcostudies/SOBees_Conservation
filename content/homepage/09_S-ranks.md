<h4> 
Vermont is one of a few states with a complete conservation ranking of its entire bee fauna

A critical step in setting priorities for biodiversity conservation is an assessment of extinction risk. This requires detailed knowledge of the distribution, population size and trends, and critical threats for each species. The <a href="https://www.natureserve.org/products/conservation-rank-calculator" target="blank_"><u>NatureServe Conservation Rank Calculator</u></a> enables conservation biologists to translate this knowledge into three categories of information: rarity, threats and trends. The tool uses these data to determine an overall conservation status rank by automatically applying specific rules.

We have assigned preliminary <a href="https://vtfishandwildlife.com/sites/fishandwildlife/files/documents/Learn%20More/Library/REPORTS%20AND%20DOCUMENTS/NONGAME%20AND%20NATURAL%20HERITAGE/ENDANGERED%2C%20THREATENED%20AND%20RARE%20SPECIES%20LISTS/Explanation-of-Legal-Status-and-Information-Ranks.pdf" target="blank_"><u>state conservation ranks (S-ranks)</u></a> to 335 native bee species in Vermont. Ten species that had no records after the year 2000 were assigned an SH (Historical) or SX (Extirpated). Over 30% of Vermont’s extant native bee species are preliminarily ranked as critically imperiled or imperiled. Many critically imperiled species are known from just a few records, often from a single location, and with no direct information about population trends. Many of these species may be naturally rare in Vermont, making their populations susceptible to environmental perturbations. On the opposite spectrum, nearly 23% of native bee species are apparently secure or secure. More occurrence records and threat assessments are needed to improve upon these rankings and clarify some ranks.

From 2012-2014 we surveyed the bumble bee community across Vermont. Trained community scientists joined us to search thousands of locations across the state and recorded more than 10,000 individual bumble bee encounters. We compared the survey data to historic specimens that we identified to species and digitized from public and private collections. The results provided sobering news about the status of Vermont’s 17 bumble bee species and led to the listing of four species as Threatened or Endangered in Vermont, one federally Endangered (Rusty-patched Bumble Bee), and added 9 species to the 2015 Wildlife Action Plan as Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN). Using this criteria, <b>we identified 48 bee species that we believe are in urgent need of conservation efforts</b> and should be considered for SGCN status when the State Wildlife Action Plan is updated in 2025. Additionally, our knowledge of Vermont bees was incorporated into the Northeast Fish and Wildlife recent update to the list of Regional Species of Greatest Conservation Need. The list now includes 19 bee species that have been recorded in Vermont.
