Twelve Important Bee Areas are designated as priority locations for protection and bee-focused management
</h5>
</div>

Building on the concept of Important Bird Areas, we identified 12 areas as Important Bee Areas (IBeeA). This network of sites is vital to the long-term viability of bee diversity in Vermont. An IBeeA can be large or small, public or private, and must meet one of several objective criteria. 

<!--
<div class="flex-column-container">
<div class="first-col">
<b><u>Important bee areas</u></b>, or IBeeAs for short were delineated using the following criteria:
<ol>
<li>Support multiple rare or local bee species, with an emphasis on specialists and regionally rare species</li>
<li>Habitats that are geographically limited in the state, threatened by human impacts, and/or of regional significance</li>
<li>Extensive areas of relatively pristine and unique habitat</li>
</ol>
<b><u>Priority survey Regions</u></b> are areas with unique habitats or undersampled regions that we've identified.
These priority regions require additional surveys to assess bee populations. Several locations throughout Vermont harbor unique bee communities.

The Following criteria were used to guide our selection process to identify <b><u>Important bee areas (IBeeAs)</u></b>:

<ol>
<li>Support multiple specialist bees or regionally rare species</li>
<li>Special bee habitats that are rare in Vermont, and/or are regionally significant</li>
</ol>

All of these areas contain a mix of conserved, public and privately owned land, with a unique set of threats and conservation priorities. More detailed management suggestions will be provided in the future for many of the habitats and species covered by these IBeeAs, but it's not too early for land managers to be considering rare bees in management decisions. Since the IBeeA program is voluntary, there are no legal or regulatory restrictions.

<b><u>Priority survey Regions</u></b> are areas with unique habitats or undersampled regions that we've identified.
These priority regions require additional surveys to assess bee populations. Several locations throughout Vermont harbor unique bee communities.
