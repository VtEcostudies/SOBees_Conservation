There has been a growing interest in pollinator conservation in yards and gardens with nationwide campaigns such as <a href=”https://beecityusa.org/no-mow-may/”><u>No Mow May</u></a>, <a href=”https://beecityusa.org/”><u>Bee City USA</u></a>, the <a href=”http://millionpollinatorgardens.org/”><u>Million Pollinator Garden Challenge</a></u>, and others.

Most wild bees need flowers, yet not all flowers are created equal, and there are other considerations that go into great pollinator habitat. Bees also need nesting habitat which ranges from dead flower stalks to bare, sandy soils. There are many <a href=https://val.vtecostudies.org/projects/vtbees/pollinator-habitat/><u>resources</u></a> that can help you turn your yard and garden into a spectacular pollinator haven.

While there is a lot that a landowner can do to actively encourage native bees, there is also a lot that can inadvertently harm them. Clearing of native shrubs and flowers, frequent mowing, and pesticide and herbicide treatments are all likely to be harmful. Some nurseries sell plants that have been pre-treated with pesticides such as neonicotinoids, a group of insecticides that are toxic to bees even in small quantities that are absorbed by plants and can be present in pollen and nectar. Ask about any treatments before you buy. Some companies are now selling live mason and leafcutter bees with bee hotels that can be installed in a garden. This can spread parasites, pathogens, and introduce exotic bee species or genes to local populations.
