From large meadows to backyard pollinator gardens, every landscape can help support pollinators

Thanks to campaigns like “No Mow May” and “Bee City USA”, there is a growing interest in backyard bee conservation. There are many resources for creating backyard bee habitat, some of which are compiled here: https://val.vtecostudies.org/projects/vtbees/pollinator-habitat/

While there is a lot that a landowner can do to actively encourage native bees, there is also a lot that can inadvertently harm native bees. Clearing of native shrubs and flowers, frequent mowing, and pesticide and herbicide treatments are all likely to be harmful to local bee populations. Some nurseries sell plants that have been pre-treated with  pesticides such as neonicotinoids, a group of insecticides that are toxic to bees even in small quantities that are absorbed by plants and can be present in pollen and nectar. Ask about any treatments before you buy. Some companies are now selling live mason and leafcutter bees with bee hotels that can be installed in a garden to “increase the local bee population". This can spread parasites, pathogens and introduce exotic bee species or genes to local populations.
