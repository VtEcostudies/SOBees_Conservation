Using a combination of field work, expert opinion, and species distribution modeling, weâ€™ve identified important regions, habitats, and individual species that are the highest conservation priorities. Some of these habitats and their associated bees are limited to relatively natural landscapes, but backyards, farms, and city parks can all support a diversity of bees with sound management practices.
