Bee communities are the assemblages of species that occur together in a given location. Using occurrence data for 235 native bee species, we created species distribution models that allowed us to compare bee communities across Vermont at the scale of one square kilometer. Using these data we were able to identify areas within the state that support unique bee communities. Identifying these areas within Vermont is critical to maintain bee diversity into the future. Many of these areas warrant further investigation, but conservation action should be a priority.
